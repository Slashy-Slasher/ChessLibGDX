Chess Board in Java using LibGDX

  While the project isn't finished yet, the game board is fully playable. Once the ability to undo a move using the 'Z' key and the new font is added through the FreeType Library, the project could be considered completed. Despite this, there are some other Quality of Life things that I wouold like to add such as showing legal and illegal moves.

**Currently Implemented**
Moveable Pieces
Taking Pieces
Castling (Techinically)

**In Progress**
Undoing moves
Showing Legal Moves
Preventing Illegal moves
Adding Fonts for Pieces(Pieces are currently represented as Unique Integer Values)
